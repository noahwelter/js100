# Exercises - Functions

1. It logs 1 (value of global variable bar). Executing foo() does not affect the output because there is a new bar variable initialized within the function that is block scoped to that function.

2. See [greeter.js](greeter.js)

3. See [multiply.js](multiply.js)

4. Nothing - the function will return before reaching line 4 and logging the words value.

5. Nothing - there is no console.log() call.
